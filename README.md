    ## Hi there, first of all, thank you;
    <div class="myStory">
      I'm Maby, currently 16 (I don't even think I will remember to update this);
      Born and living in Taiwan;
      When I was choosing the high school I had to study years ago, I chose a normal High school instead of a Technical High School (It makes a huge difference in Taiwan);
      But nearly a year ago, I found out that what I really want to do in the future is probably Designing, UI/UX and Front-end, so I started to learn all these by myself;
      Even in this second, everything still looks so impossible and futureless, but;
